======== To Do: ========

- make arrow keys work with dropdown, make tab work with checkbox

- check if color is valid first

- popover is going over input and can't get rid of it... just make an alert myself?

- button for link and remove link in url?

======== Maybe: ========

- info modal about barcodes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode#Types_of_barcodes

- info modal with link to github, version number, link to email, link to donate



- change focus outline color

- make custom accent color (mobile theme color, button color, etc)



- remove option from url if it's already default option

- use atob() and btoa() to encode all info into shorter url
