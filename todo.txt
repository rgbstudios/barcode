======== To Do: ========

- Wifi QR code generator / reader
- WIFI:T:WPA;S:networkname;P:passwordname;;

- make arrow keys work with dropdown

- check if color is valid first

- popover is going over input and can't get rid of it... just make an alert myself?

- clicking checkbox doesn't toggle it, only label works

- option to print them, textarea input or file upload and make barcodes for each one
	set the margin and settings and either print or make a pdf or document or image for download

======== Maybe: ========

- info modal about barcodes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode#Types_of_barcodes

- info modal with link to github, version number, link to email, link to donate

- remove option from url if it's already default option

- use atob() and btoa() to encode all info into shorter url

- history list of scanned codes below?

- scan normal barcodes too?

======== Notes: ========

- might need to run "py -m http.server 4000" to host on localhost: 4000 to allow camera permission 

- could make accent color red (#933), use in focus/highlight color and other places, looks good with black
	problem is, red is associated with warning/danger, so be careful with design

- FIX default open or dont open qr code modal
