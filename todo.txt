======== To Do: ========

- add margin to qr codes (currently only on barcodes, important for scanability)

- Wifi QR code generator / reader
- WIFI:T:WPA;S:networkname;P:passwordname;;

- link toggle button that adds or removes url params in link

- make arrow keys work with dropdown

- check if color is valid first

- popover is going over input and can't get rid of it... just make an alert myself?

- clicking checkbox doesn't toggle it, only label works

- option to print them, textarea input or file upload and make barcodes for each one
	set the margin and settings and either print or make a pdf or document or image for download

- make dropdown button more accessible

- focus close btn on modal open

- links to share at bottom (similar to sharethis but less intrusive)

======== Bugs: ========

- color picker can be inaccessible

======== Maybe: ========

- wifi qr code: easy print option that opens it formatted to 8.5x11 or a4 paper, ready to print
- checkboxes to display network name and/or pass

- info modal about barcodes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode#Types_of_barcodes

- info modal with link to github, version number, link to email, link to donate, by justin golden, (c)

- remove option from url if it's already default option

- use atob() and btoa() to encode all info into shorter url

- history list of scanned codes below?

- scan normal barcodes too?

- info modal about qr codes and about wifi qr codes, how to use on phone

======== Aesthetic: ========

- try using tailwind css instead of bootstrap?

- update range inputs

======== Notes: ========

- no wifi info in url param: security

- if downloaded image doesn't work, sometimes right click copy and paste works to send qr codes

- might need to run "py -m http.server 4000" to host on localhost: 4000 to allow camera permission 

- could make accent color red (#933), use in focus/highlight color and other places, looks good with black
	problem is, red is associated with warning/danger, so be careful with design

- FIX default open or dont open qr code modal
